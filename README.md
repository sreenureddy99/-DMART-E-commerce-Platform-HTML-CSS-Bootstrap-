## About
The DMART E-Commerce Platform is a fully responsive online shopping website developed using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. This platform was designed to provide an intuitive and seamless shopping experience for users across all devices, from desktops to smartphones. The use of HTML for structuring the platform, CSS for styling, and Bootstrap for its mobile-first, grid-based layout ensured that the website is not only visually appealing but also functional and easy to navigate.

The platform features a clean, modern user interface (UI) with a focus on simplicity and accessibility, allowing users to easily browse through product categories, add items to their shopping cart, and complete their purchase with minimal effort. By incorporating Bootstrap, the development process was streamlined, allowing for reusable components and responsive design that automatically adapts to different screen sizes. The navigation system is designed to be straightforward, helping customers find what they need quickly and efficiently.
